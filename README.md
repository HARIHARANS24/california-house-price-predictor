## Dataset

- **Source:** California Housing dataset from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset)
- **Description:** Contains 20,640 samples from the 1990 California census with 8 feature variables and one target (median house value).
- **Features:**

  | Feature    | Description                                |
  |------------|--------------------------------------------|
  | MedInc     | Median income in block group (10k USD)     |
  | HouseAge   | Median house age in block group (years)    |
  | AveRooms   | Average rooms per household                 |
  | AveBedrms  | Average bedrooms per household              |
  | Population | Population of the block group               |
  | AveOccup   | Average household occupancy                  |
  | Latitude   | Latitude coordinate                         |
  | Longitude  | Longitude coordinate                        |

- **Target:**

  | Target | Description                          |
  |--------|------------------------------------|
  | price  | Median house value (in 100,000 USD) |

## Model

- **Algorithm:** XGBoost Regressor
- **Why XGBoost?**  
  Known for superior performance and efficiency on tabular data, XGBoost is a robust choice for regression tasks.
- **Training Details:**  
  Dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing with a fixed random seed.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - RÂ² Score (coefficient of determination)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
